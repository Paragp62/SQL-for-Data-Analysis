This project is part of my Data Analyst Internship (Task 3: SQL for Data Analysis).
The goal is to perform structured data analysis using SQL on a Superstore-style e-commerce dataset.

I have used MySQL to:

Write SQL queries

Analyze sales, profit, and customer behavior

Create views and subqueries

Optimize queries using indexes
